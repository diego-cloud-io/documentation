# Deploying your application

In Diego Hub, you can select to:

- Add an existing Github app to Diego: Diego opens a PR on the existing app repo with `.diego` folder

- Create a brand new app with Diego: Diego creates the repo in github for you with `.diego` folder.

The `.diego` folder will contain a `config.yaml` file with app level configuration, for getting apps deployed with some defaults.
