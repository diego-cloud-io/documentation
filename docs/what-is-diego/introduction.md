# Meet Diego ♾️

Diego is an integrated platform which streamlines the software development process with easier management of cloud infrastructure and application deployments workflows. It improves cycle times for delivering changes to production. 

Diego consists of an easy to use UI called **Diego Hub**, custom kubernetes operators, along with a pre-configured collection of open source tooling for building, deploying and monitoring microservices on Kubernetes. The platform implements a set of industry best practices and has an open architecture making it extensibile as needed. 

Diego is based on the GitOps principle that focuses on keeping the infrastructure definitions and application deployment specifications in Git. The built-in application controller, implemented as a Kubernetes operator, orchestrates application deployments from Git to Kubernetes. It also provides version management and approval gates. Diego provides presets for configuration across its toolchain to get you started, which can be adjusted according to deployment needs.

Diego is designed to be modular and can be installed just as its core or including all constituent parts together. The following represent different packs:

● **Core pack:** This provides all the core Diego components that deliver basic CD tooling and support orchestration <br/>
● **Infrastructure Pack:** This pack further enhances the core setup and enables management of cloud infrastructure components<br/>
● **Monitoring Pack:** This pack consists of necessary tooling and configuration required for monitoring services on Kubernetes.<br/>

> Diego is designed to be a self-service platform for engineering teams seeking to deploy and monitor their applications without reliance on cloud platform teams.

## Diego empowers: 

●  **Lead Engineers:** seeking to confidently onboard their applications for faster and safer deployments.

●  **Developers:** deploying software daily, with the option to visualise the impact of their code from feature branches in preview environments.

●  **CTOs and Heads of Engineering:** wanting to join up the dots and ensure that their cloud setup is structured, well-designed and free from sprawl. 

## Diego in a Nutshell: 

●  **Pre-configured** with fully integrated set of open-source tools.

●  **Declarative** model for infrastructure provisioning and application deployment across environments.

●  **Standardised** logging, metric and trace collection.

●  **Pre-configured** scalable, reliable and resilient Kubernetes cluster.

●  **Sleek** developer experience with deployment feedback delivered straight to Github, along with a single consolidated UI for visualising the value stream.
